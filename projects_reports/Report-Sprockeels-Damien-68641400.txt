SUBJECT : SWGoHBOT

CONTEXT
	SWGoHBOT is a discord bot related to the mobile game Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes owned by Capital Games. It contains 
numerous usefull functions allowing players to improve their gaming experience. The functionnality I decided to contribute to
is the ;ga command, which allows players to compare 20 different characters from both players to help you come up with a strategy
better suited for your opponent. It also compares some characteristics from both players.
	
CONTACT WITH THE COMMUNITY
	The discussion channel is obviously on discord, since the bot itself is on discord. There aren't a lot of regular contributors,
but rather a lot of occasionnal contributors. Most of the interractions I had were thus with the creator of the bot himself. However, 
I still had some interractions with other contributors as well.
	
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
	Overall, I would say my first experience in the open source world was rather positive. I learned how an open source project works,
both on the community aspect and the more technical aspect, and acquired knowledge regarding node.js and databases (PostgresQL,MongoDB).

ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS
	As I had no experience nor in the open source world nor in web developing, I had trouble to get the project to run on my 
computer. The procedure to follow to install and launch the project was rather straightforward on the git, but there was no
information about how to get the databases to work. It took a lot of time and effort to get them to work, but I eventually succeeded 
thanks to the help of other contributors and perseverence. I thus had less time than I hoped to work on the functionnality I planned 
on contributing to.

CONTRIBUTION
	In a nutshell, my contribution was to update the list of characters compared by the ;ga functionnality. Indeed, I thought it 
was outdated due to recent changes in the game. I also started working on a similar functionnality for ships instead of characters, 
but due to timing constrains I was unable to finish it. I will still work on that in the future. The community seemed to be thrilled 
by this idea when I suggested it.

CONCLUSION
	This experience opened the doors to new opportunities for me, and I was pleasantly surprised. I think I will keep 
contributing to this project in the future, especially since I use it a lot. It is something I wasn't expecting when I started 
this project. I will probably create a guide to help future contributors to get the databases to work so they don't have to waste 
as much time as I did.
