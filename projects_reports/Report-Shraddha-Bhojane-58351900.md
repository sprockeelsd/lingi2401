Aim: Contribute to Open Source

Searching for a project: When I started with this course, I was determined on contributing to "Talend Open Source" which is a Java Based BI tool.
After a little research, I realised that the community is very large and it has reached a level of experties that don't require a basic piece of Java anymore.
So I started my research from a whole new beginning where I landed on some cool projects like VLC, PDFJS, and a lot many which I made use of in other subjects as tools.
The one I started my project with was "Strongbox" which is a Java based(Maven and Spring boot) Artifact Repository. I enjoyed the experience of joining and starting with a community, but the project was large.
It required months of work where as in two months I could only pick the courage to join a Open Source community.
So parallely I searched for more projects and I landed on "30-secons-of-code". This website is targeted towards young developers and beginners. 
It consists of small code snippets in Java Script, HTML and few other languages and the goal of this website is to make the reader understand a snippet of code under 30 seconds.

My Contribution: A Javascript snippet that calculates angle between two vectors.

Why this project: I wish I knew about a website as such when I started coding. Although I started coding very late during my college, efficient surfing and online learning was not much of a trend in India.
Which lead me to books, and other conventional ways of learning, which I still do but much less. Internet in the last 5 years has expanded massively for me and exploring sometimes becomes overwhelming.
30-seconds-of-code becomes personal on so many levels in this scenario that I could not resist picking it.

Future: My pull request at 30-seconds-of-code is still not accepted and I am still working with strongbox and pdfjs

My take-away: Do not be afraid of exploring and most importantly of asking. I wasted a lot of time self-doubting before I actually made the pull request with 30-seconds-of-code

Conclusion:
1. The pull request at 30-secons-of-code is still pending
2. I am more confident contributing to Open source
