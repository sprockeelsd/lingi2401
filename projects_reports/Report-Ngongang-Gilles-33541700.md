## Research and Selection of the Project

For my project selection, being interesting in peer reviews and how it can be a good tool to motivate and encourage participation in
projects especially group project, i decided to research on open-source peer evaluation tool and i discovered Teammates. 

Teammates is not only a great peer evaluation and feedback tool for students, it is equally an awesome open-source project that 
encourages collaboration from every one even first timers. As such they proposed a detailed step-to-step guide for those that want
to contribute by guiding them on how to install the working environment to how add a contribution. Teammates encouraging contributions
by submitting fixes to open issues. These issues are equally tag labelled to indicate their level of difficulty.


## Contributions

After following the very detailed guideline from Teammates, i set-up a local working environment and launched , the front-end 
and back-end server. I then went on to study the program structure and functioning. As a first timer in open-source software 
contribution, i choice a first timer tagged open issue: https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/9886 . 
This concerned the login drop down menu being hidden by the scroll bar.

I programmed and tested several possible fixes to the issues, a more complicated back-end fix and some simple front-end fixes. 
I finally submitted they fix i found more elegant and straight forward which involved simply modifying the right margin of 
the element in the CSS so its position was in terms of percent and was  adapted to the containing bloc and always a little
distanced from the scroll bar. I submitted my proposed fix: https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9892 .

As a first timer, i think Teammates was they best place to start with as they help you at every step of your contribution
from setting up a local working environment to structuring your contribution.
