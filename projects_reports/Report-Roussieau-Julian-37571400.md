## What's darktable
[Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) is an open source photography workflow application and raw developer. It is the equivalent to Adobe lightroom but in open source.

## Why this project
1. It's a tool I use
2. Their site is up to date and explains how to contribute and launch the project.
3. The community is active. There are daily commits as well as an IRC.

## How i did it
1. Since I don't know where to start, I asked for help on the IRC server.
2. I was advised this [issue](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/3343).
3. So I made a [pull request](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/3356).
4. Unfortunately it was not accepted
> Thanks for helping but this part also affects many other items of the UI. So, yes it fixes #3343 but bring new issues. Not wanted.
5. But later that day, [I was told that my contribution allowed them to see things differently](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/3343#issuecomment-552183197).

## Conclusion
At the beginning it was difficult to find a project and a contribution to make. I was able to realize through this project, that I may not have been able to solve the problem entirely myself, but that I was still able to help someone solve it. Today, we can all benefit from this contribution.
