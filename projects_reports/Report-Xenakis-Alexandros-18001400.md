## Research and Project Selection
The first step in making a contribution to a project is to actually find the project. Initially, I was looking for a project written in scala, as I wanted to work with this language from some time already. After some time of research, I found LILA, aka LIchess for scaLA. This is an open source chess web engine initially developed by Thibault Duplessis (aka ornicar) and was exactly what I was looking for. After many hours trying to set up the program locally on my machine, I thought I started with a project too big for a first contribution (at least for me) and changed project. As I could not find another project written in scala I actually liked, I decided to expand my research. 

After some time, I found Jarvis, a project aspiring to implement an open source version of a personal assistant such as Siri or Alexa. The project is written in python and after looking at the source code, I felt comfortable contributing to it. 


## Contribution
Jarvis uses a system with plugins allowing any contribution to be added easily by following a plugin template. Many of the usual features were already included in the project, and I thought I would add a utility that is less about functionality, but would maybe add some fun to the project. A good idea, I thought, would be to add a version of Akinator. Akinator is a game where a "genie" named Akinator guesses a character you have in mind after you answer some of his questions. As a python library implementing this game already existed, this is what I ended up doing. The process was pretty straight forward. I implemented a first version that uses the akinator library and integrates it in the project and submitted a first PR. Then, I found a bug in a specific scenario, but also understood the PEP8 python standards were not met. The PR was therefore edited, which was later accepted.
